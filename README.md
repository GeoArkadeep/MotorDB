# MotorDB
A simple python app with GUI to estimate RPM and torque of downhole positive displacement motor, given surface torque and flow rate values. The derived coefficients are appended to a json file, allowing the user to build up a databse of mud motors in common use, allowing use in converting large arrays or streams of data.
